Clickvote is an open-source likes and upvotes infrastructure powered by websockets. It allows to seamlessly integrate like and upvotes components
into any website, SPA or a no-code tool.

There is absolutely no reason any developer should ever build upvotes infrastructure from scratch. Clickvote makes so many things easy for you:

- Multiple pre-built components (likes, ratings, stars, feedback)
- SDKs for your favorite framework (React, Vue, Svelte, HTML, etc)
- Instant analytics (URL, time, geo)
- Zero headaches managing websockets!
