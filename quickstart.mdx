As an example, we will add like component to [Clickvote](https://clickvote.dev) website.

## Install Clickvote client library

As of now, we have client library only for React. More coming soon.

Get started by installing Clickvote React library:

```bash
npm i @clickvote/react
```

## Sign up to Clickvote cloud

Create a free Clickvote account (no credit card required).

<a href="https://app.clickvote.dev" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/try-clickvote-cloud.svg"
    alt="Try Clickvote Cloud"
    width="215"
  />
</a>

## Create a new vote

Go to [votes](https://app.clickvote.dev/votes) page to create a new vote. Click on a `Add Vote` button.

<Frame caption="Add new vote">
  <img src="/images/clickvote_add_vote_arrow.png" alt="Clickvote Votes Pages" />
</Frame>

Give some name to your new vote and select a type (single for likes, range for ratings). Click `Save`.

<Frame caption="Save new vote">
  <img src="/images/clickvote_save_vote.png" alt="Clickvote Save Vote" />
</Frame>

## Integrate Clickvote into a website

After you saved the vote, you should see this page:

<Frame caption="Clickvote snippet page">
  <img
    src="/images/clickvote_vote_snippet_page.png"
    alt="Clickvote Snippet Page"
  />
</Frame>

In a top right corner you can select a type of the component you want (likes or upvotes).
Then, you can simply copy and paste provided snippet into your website.

In Clickvote `Vote` actually refers to a group of votes. So for instance, we want to include likes component on every page of Clickvote website.
Obviously, we don't need to create a new vote for each of the pages.

All the components will share the same `id`, but they will have different `voteTo`. Basically, `voteTo` indicates an item inside of vote group.
It can be any string, for example name of the page or URL:

```jsx
return (
  <ClickVoteProvider
    value={{
      apiUrl: "socket.clickvote.dev",
      publicKey: "pb_zCKP4ozxpkxXJyIpfmWIpsE8wgH5BAXF",
      userId: visitor,
    }}
  >
    <ClickVoteComponent id="clickvote-likes" voteTo={window.location.href}>
      {(props) => <LikeBtn {...props} />}
    </ClickVoteComponent>
  </ClickVoteProvider>
);
```

Another important attribute is a `userId`. Currently Clickvote requires it to identify user and prevent the same person from doing multiple votes.

After you added this snippet to your website, you should see a live clickable component.

**Yay, you just integrated Clickvote into your website!**

<Frame caption="Live Clickvote component">
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    className="w-full aspect-video rounded"
    src="/images/clickvote_looping_click.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>
